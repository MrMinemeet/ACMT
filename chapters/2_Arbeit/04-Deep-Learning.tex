\section{What is Deep Learning?}

Deep learning is a set of algorithms in machine
learning that attempt to learn in multiple levels, corresponding to different levels of abstraction. It typically uses artificial
neural networks. The levels in these learned statistical models
correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones, and the same lower-level concepts can help to define many higher-level concepts. For example you can compare lower level concepts with edges and higher level concepts with faces. 

Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised, and unsupervised. The main difference between the two types is that supervised learning is done using a ground truth, or in other words, we have prior knowledge of what the output values for our samples should be. Therefore, the goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that, given a sample of data and desired outputs, best approximates the relationship between input and output observable in the data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not have labeled outputs, so its goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.

\section{Supervised Learning}

In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well "labeled." It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

\subsubsection{\textit{Advantages of supervised learning:}}
Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.
Helps you to optimize performance criteria using experience
Supervised machine learning helps you to solve various types of real-world computation problems.

\section{Unsupervised Learning}
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It deals with unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning deep learning methods.

\subsubsection{\textit{Advantages of unsupervised learning:}}
Unsupervised machine learning finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
Unsupervised methods help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of learners.
It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual intervention.

\section{Semi-Supervised Learning}
Labeled data is often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain.  Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there have been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice.
