\section{What is Deep Learning?}

Deep learning is a set of algorithms in machine
learning that attempt to learn in multiple levels, corresponding to different levels of abstraction. It typically uses artificial
neural networks. The levels in these learned statistical models
correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones, and the same lower-level concepts can help to define many higher-level concepts. For example you can compare lower level concepts with edges and higher level concepts with faces.
